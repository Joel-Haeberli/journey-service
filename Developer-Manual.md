[Support Mailbox](mailto:journey-service@sbb.ch)

## Abstract
The Journey-Service is a RESTful **"Journey-Planner"** facade abstracting **public transportation routing and planning** for a set of **SBB Switzrland** relevant underlying systems, such as Hafas, HIM, CUS, INFO+, DiDok, CAPRE, FOS, PLABE, OccupancyPrognosis, NOVA etc.

The main **Use Cases** are:
* Finding **`Place`** (aka OJP `Location`), such as `StopPlace` resp. (stations for public transport trains, busses, tramways, ..), `AddressPlace` and `PoiPlace` (Points of Interest (POI)).
* Finding concrete journeys (`Trip`, `DatedVehicleJourney`) as passenger-information.
* Finding some SBB specific additional info (such as `Trainformation`s, Realtime monitoring etc)

A set of implemented **SBB Business Rules** (such as delays, platform changes,..) guarantees that consuming channels may display consistent data.

If you are new to journey-planning with SBB, consider general standards as mentioned in [chapter "Routing Standards in "Public Transport"](v3/Journey-Service_v3_MODEL.md)

### Design Goals
* Strategic usage for SBB and partners: **Journey-Planner** systems are a business critical core functionality at SBB. Plenty of Consumer applications use it (like [sbb.ch](https://www.sbb.ch/en/home.html), [SBB Mobile](https://www.sbb.ch/de/fahrplan/mobile-fahrplaene/sbb-mobile.html), [SBB Ticket vending machines](https://www.sbb.ch/de/bahnhof-services/am-bahnhof/services-am-billettautomat/sbb-billettautomat.html), [SBB Group reservation and Capacity management](https://company.sbb.ch/de/sbb-als-geschaeftspartner/dienstleistungen/vertriebsmanagement-ktu/produkte/capre.html), [SBB B2P](https://company.sbb.ch/content/dam/sbb/de/pdf/sbb-konzern/sbb-als-geschaeftspartner/partnervertrieb/webserviceB2P_factsheet_d.pdf) and many others.
* [Business aspects](BusinessAspects.md): all consumer get the same information (we work hard to enhance quality and continuous feature innovation).
* Easy usage by consumer developers: Our APIs are **RESTful** and documented, [Openapi 3](https://oai.github.io/Documentation/) **generated ApiClient** capable.

### Good to know
#### Release Notes
See [SBB staff release notes](https://code.sbb.ch/projects/KI_FAHRPLAN/repos/journey-service/browse/ReleaseNotes.md)
Because J-S heavily relies on the Journey-Assistant library, also those [J-A Release-Notes](https://code.sbb.ch/projects/KI_FAHRPLAN/repos/journey-assistant/browse/ReleaseNotes.md) might reveal some important updates.

## API in detail
All Services (short abstract, request-parameters, response-models) are documented directly by swagger-annotations, therefore the documentation below is reduced to the max and is hopefully not really necessary for v2 API understanding in most cases.

### Choosing the right service definition
Select the version of J-S REST-API: currently **v3** and some **v2**.

Remark:
* If accessing by APIM, some APIs may not be visible (compared to SBB internal access) or accessable (based on your "plan per API").
* v1 is deprecated and for reserved SBB internal usage

![Version JSON-definition](resources/J-S_version.png)

| Aspect | /v2 (current version) | /v3 |
|--------|-----------------------|-----|
|API-Path|/b2c/v2/*              | /v3 |
|Request-Header	|like "Accept-Language" is used for standard or meta aspects (which are not in)|dito|
|Request-Params|GET ?param1=..&param2=..|dito|
|Response-Header|like "Content-Language" (relates to "Accept-Language" or fallback-language by J-S)|dito|
|Response-Body|returns HttpStatus and declared model or `Problem`|dito|
|arg defaulting|better defaulting (for minimal performance)|dito|
|Realtime handling|less but well calculated attributes â†’ consumer needs to analyze much less or nothing at all|dito

### End-user consistency
According to **SBB KI strategy (de:Kundeninformation)** it is a **declared goal to communicate consistent public transport information**! 
**J-S plays an important role** to provide such consistency **to any passengers on any end-user API resp. UI-channel**.

**J-S consumers must be aware that they might violate these SBB business rules by ignoring, manipulating or redefining given values and may impact unwanted end-user or public media critics**.

Some expressions are even related to **conventions by [BAV](https://www.bav.admin.ch/bav/de/home/verkehrsmittel/eisenbahn.html), SBB Infrastructure, SBB Personenverkehr or public transport Switzerland** in general.

### Request
For each Request to J-S set the mandatory header-fields (especially "Authorization", "Request-Id", Accept-Language) and body fields as given in the [Service-Contract per API](https://developer.sbb.ch/apis/journey-service/documentation).

A word about GET and POST:
* J-S offers **genererally idempotent GET** requests (since "Journey-Planners" are mostly information providing systems). However for technical reasons (like very long URL) a few APIs are specificied according to [SBB RESTful Principles: GET with BODY](https://schweizerischebundesbahnen.github.io/api-principles/restful/principles/#get-with-body) or [Zalando RESTful](https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines/#get-with-body). Both variants are implemented according to this rule:
1. **GET** with **complex parameters enforce JSON-Objects** (as consumer you will have to URL encode such JSON objects to prevent transmitting marshalling faults)
2. **POST** replacements like /v3/trips/* are still to be understood as an **idempotent** GET request, the API description contains a hint like _Idempotent GET with Body_.
