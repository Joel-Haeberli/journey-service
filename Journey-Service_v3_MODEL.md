# Journey-Service (J-S)

This is about the **implemented routing exchange model** provided by J-S.

## Standards
### Transmodel
The main reference is Transmodel [**TRM6-v56** (downloads and tutorials)](https://www.transmodel-cen.eu/downloads/).
* Be aware, this is rather a **conceptual specification** and the J-S Team did not find a satisfying reference-implementation yet. However our team is convinced to take this as the main guideline for J-S v3.
